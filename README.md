## The Learning Process

1. **Start with Data**  
   - Input: House size, number of rooms, location score  
   - Output: Price in dollars  

2. **Bias (Base Price)**  
   - The starting price of a house before adding any features.  

3. **Weights (Sliders)**  
   - Show how much each factor matters for the price.  

4. **Prediction Line**  
   - The computer finds the best line through the data to make predictions.

## What You’ll Do

- See a small dataset of houses  
- Train a simple model  
- Find the **base price** and **weights**  
- Predict prices for new houses (you can change the inputs!)  
- Draw the prediction line
